### What I learned

I learned to make a column wise responsive layout while making sure everything looks good.
<br>
I also played around a bit and learned to make triangles with css borders.

```css
.end-info::after {
  /* ... */
  border-right: solid var(--triangle-size) white;
  border-left: solid var(--triangle-size) transparent;
  border-top: solid var(--triangle-size) white;
  border-bottom: solid var(--triangle-size) transparent;
}
```
